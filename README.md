# Brewology

The aim of the brewology project is to be a project based experience in the MERN stack. We will be using mongo, along with node/express and react/redux for the front end. For our build tool we will be using webpack. For styling we will be working with Less or possibly PostCSS. As this project grows, we will look into other technologies to enhance our project and challenge our abilities.

### Version 0.5

Version 0.5 will have the following features:

1. MongoDB - We will be converting the intial breweries database over from a MySQL DB to a mongo DB purely for learning purposes and not for any performance differences between a relational and non-relational DB. We will be hosting the db on mongolabs intially.
2. Node/Express - We will start implementing node/express to access our db with node/express and to create our web services through Express.
3. React/Redux - We will be consuming the JSON data from our back end with a react/redux platform.
4. Less/PostCSS - this will be for our styling. 
5. Webpack - this will be our build tool that we use to translate the ES6/Babel and less files on the front end.

### Version 1.0

1. Fetching of db data - We will successfully grab the data from mongodb from our node setup
2. Passing data to API endpoing with Express - We will pass the fetched data  through our express suite to the API endpoint
3. Initial frontend - We will make a rudimentary site with minimal styling to demonstrate that the information is successfully being passed from express to redux and rendered with react.

### Version 1.5

Features considering for implementations:  
-authorization(token authorization)  
-public/private site based off authorization  
-inputting of data from logged in user  
-mapping of brewries for users  
-implementation of 3rd party APIs to enhance our project
